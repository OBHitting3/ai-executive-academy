## 💰 HOW TO ADD YOUR AFFILIATE LINKS

**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

Search for `affiliateLink:` and replace with your real affiliate links:

```typescript
const AI_TOOLS: AITool[] = [
  {
    id: 'chatgpt',
    name: 'ChatGPT Plus',
    // REPLACE THIS:
    affiliateLink: 'https://chat.openai.com/?ref=YOUR_AFFILIATE_ID',
    ...
  },
  // Repeat for all 6 tools
];
```

**How to get affiliate links:**

1. **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**: Apply at https://openai.com/partnerships
2. **Anthropic (Claude)**: Email partnerships@anthropic.com
3. **Midjourney**: Join Discord, ask in #support
4. **ElevenLabs**: https://elevenlabs.io/affiliates
5. **Perplexity**: Email team@perplexity.ai
6. **Runway**: https://runwayml.com/partners

**OR start without affiliates:**
- Use regular signup links (no referral)
- Add affiliate links later when approved
- Users still get value, you still get training revenue ($99)

2. "Have a promo code?" → Enter **Ron**

**If he's impressed:**
