# Day 1: The 30-Second Email Trick â˜•

## Morning Coffee Script (3-5 minutes)

### Cold Open (0-20s)
[Screen: Black. Coffee brewing sound]

"It's 6:04 AM.

You haven't had your coffee yet.

Your inbox has 47 unread messages.

Your board wants an update on Q4 results.

And your kid just spilled cereal on the floor.

[Ghost appears on screen - Casper logo]

**Hi. I'm Casper. And I'm about to save you 30 minutes.**"

### The Problem (20s-1:15)
[B-roll: Stressed executive, messy desk, coffee]

"Here's what used to happen:

You'd open your laptop.
Stare at a blank email.
Type 'Dear Board Members...'
Delete it.
Type 'Hi everyone...'
Delete it.
Check Slack.
Check your phone.
Go get more coffee.

**30 minutes later**, you finally send a mediocre email.

**There's a better way.**"

### The Solution - ChatGPT (1:15-3:00)
[Screen recording: ChatGPT interface with coffee cup graphic in corner]

"Meet your new executive assistant: ChatGPT.

But here's the thing - most people use it wrong.

They type: 'Write an email about Q4'

And ChatGPT gives them... generic garbage.

**Here's the secret formula that actually works:**

Tell it THREE things:
1. **WHO you are** (your role)
2. **WHAT you need** (the task)
3. **THE VIBE** (tone/style)

[Screen shows typing]

*'I'm the CEO of a tech company. Write an email to my board summarizing our Q4 revenue increase of 23%, highlighting our expansion into the European market and new partnerships. Professional but optimistic tone. Under 200 words. Make them excited but not overpromising.'*

[ChatGPT types response in real-time - 8 seconds]

[Pause to let viewer read the output]

**Look at that.**

That's a real email. With actual substance.

You spend 30 seconds tweaking a few words, hit send, and you're done.

**Total time: 45 seconds.**"

### The Examples (3:00-4:15)
[Quick cuts of different scenarios]

"This works for EVERYTHING:

**Client apology email?**
*'I'm a consulting partner. Write an apology email to a client for missing yesterday's deadline. Acknowledge the mistake, explain we had a server issue, and offer a 10% discount. Sincere but professional.'*

[Shows result]

**Team motivation message?**
*'I'm a sales director. Write a Slack message motivating my team after we missed our monthly target. Acknowledge the miss but focus on what we learned. Energetic but real.'*

[Shows result]

**LinkedIn post about your company win?**
*'I'm a VP of Marketing. Write a LinkedIn post about our company being named to the Inc 5000 list. Proud but humble. Make it shareable.'*

[Shows result]

**See the pattern?**

Role. Task. Vibe.

That's it."
