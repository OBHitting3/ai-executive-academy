# Day 3: Never Take Meeting Notes Again üìù

## Morning Coffee Script (3-5 minutes)

### Cold Open (0-20s)
[Screen: Person frantically typing during a Zoom call, missing what was said]

**Voiceover:**
"It's Tuesday at 2 PM.

You're on your third Zoom call.

Someone just said something important.

You're typing notes.

You missed the next thing.

Now you're lost.

[Casper ghost appears]

**What if I told you that you never have to take notes in a meeting again?**"

### The Problem (20s-1:10)
[B-roll: Meeting scenes, notebooks, typing]

"Here's what we've all done:

**Option 1:** Take notes during the meeting
‚Üí You miss half of what's being said
‚Üí Your notes are messy
‚Üí You can't find them later

**Option 2:** Record the meeting and review it later
‚Üí LOL who has time for that
‚Üí A 1-hour meeting takes 1 hour to review
‚Üí You never actually do it

**Option 3:** Just... wing it and hope you remember
‚Üí You don't
‚Üí You email everyone asking 'what did we decide?'
‚Üí You look unprepared

[Buzzer sound]

**There's a fourth option.**"

### The Solution - ChatGPT Voice Mode (1:10-3:00)
[Screen recording: ChatGPT mobile app]

"This is going to blow your mind.

**ChatGPT has a voice mode.**

You can literally TALK to it like it's a person.

And it can listen to your entire meeting.

Here's the play:

[Shows opening ChatGPT mobile app]

**Step 1:** Start ChatGPT voice mode before your meeting
(Tap the headphone icon)

**Step 2:** Tell it:
*'Listen to this meeting and take comprehensive notes. After the meeting, give me: key decisions, action items with owners, important discussion points, and follow-up questions.'*

**Step 3:** Put your phone on the table (or near your laptop speaker if it's Zoom)

**Step 4:** Have your meeting normally

**Step 5:** When it's done, tell ChatGPT:
*'The meeting is over. Give me the summary now.'*

**BOOM.**

Perfect notes.
Action items with names.
Follow-up questions.
All organized.

**Total time to review: 30 seconds.**"

### Real Example (3:00-4:00)
[Screen recording showing actual output]

"Here's a real example from a meeting I had last week:

[Shows ChatGPT summary]

**Meeting Summary:**

**Key Decisions:**
- Moving forward with the Q1 marketing campaign focused on LinkedIn
- Budget approved at $15K
- Campaign launches Feb 1st

**Action Items:**
- Sarah: Draft initial LinkedIn ad copy by Friday
- Mike: Set up analytics dashboard by Monday
- Kirk: Schedule kickoff call with design team

**Discussion Points:**
- Considered Instagram but decided LinkedIn has better ROI for B2B
- Discussed potential partnership with industry influencers
- Noted that timing aligns with conference season

**Follow-up Questions:**
- Do we need legal approval for testimonials?
- What's the backup plan if we don't hit 1000 leads?

[Pause]

**I didn't write any of that.**

I just talked. ChatGPT listened. It wrote everything.

Now I forward this to my team and everyone knows exactly what to do.

**No confusion. No 'wait what did we decide?' emails.**"

### Pro Tips (4:00-4:30)
[Quick cuts with text overlays]

"**Pro tips:**

**Tip 1:** Tell ChatGPT BEFORE the meeting starts what format you want
- Bullet points? Paragraphs? Action items only? Your call.

**Tip 2:** Use this for client calls
- After the call: 'Draft a follow-up email summarizing what we discussed'
- Send it to the client immediately
- You look incredibly on top of things

**Tip 3:** This works for lectures, podcasts, videos too
- Play any audio near ChatGPT
- Ask it to summarize
- Boom. Instant notes.

**Tip 4:** Combine with Day 1's trick
- Get the summary
- Then: 'Turn this into a professional email to send to the team'
- Copy, paste, send. Done.

**You just saved 45 minutes of work.**"
