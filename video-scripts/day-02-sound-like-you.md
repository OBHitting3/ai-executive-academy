# Day 2: Make ChatGPT Sound Like YOU (Not a Robot) ðŸŽ­

## Morning Coffee Script (3-5 minutes)

### Cold Open (0-15s)
[Screen: ChatGPT output that's clearly robotic]

**Text on screen:**
*"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the status of the aforementioned project..."*

[Record scratch sound effect]

"Yeah. That's ChatGPT without training.

**Nobody talks like that.**

[Casper ghost appears]

**Let's fix it.**"

### The Problem (15s-1:00)
[Split screen: Robot voice vs Human voice]

"Yesterday, I taught you the Role-Task-Vibe formula.

Today? We're going deeper.

**The problem:**

ChatGPT defaults to corporate robot speak.

'I hope this email finds you well...'
'Please don't hesitate to reach out...'
'I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience...'

[Vomit sound effect]

**Nobody wants to read that.**

Your clients don't. Your team doesn't. YOU don't.

So why are you sending it?"

### The Solution - Custom Instructions (1:00-3:00)
[Screen recording: ChatGPT settings]

"Here's the secret:

**You can train ChatGPT to write like you.**

Not like a LinkedIn influencer. Not like a Harvard professor.

**Like YOU.**

Here's how:

[Shows clicking on ChatGPT settings > Custom Instructions]

In the 'How would you like ChatGPT to respond?' box, add this:

**Example 1 - If you're casual:**
*'Write like a real person, not a robot. Use short sentences. No corporate jargon. Be direct and friendly. Skip the fluff. Get to the point fast.'*

[Shows typing this in]

**Example 2 - If you're more formal but not stuffy:**
*'Write professionally but conversationally. Use clear, concise language. Avoid clichÃ©s like "I hope this email finds you well" or "circling back." Sound confident, not apologetic.'*

**Example 3 - If you're funny/edgy:**
*'Write with personality. Be slightly irreverent. Use humor when appropriate. Short punchy sentences. Make it memorable.'*

[Shows different examples]

**Now watch this:**

[Split screen comparison]

**Without custom instructions:**
'I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding our upcoming meeting to discuss the proposal we submitted last week...'

**With custom instructions:**
'Hey! Quick question about the proposal we sent over. Can we hop on a call Thursday to discuss next steps?'

**See the difference?**

One sounds like a chatbot.

The other sounds like a human who respects your time."

### Advanced Move (3:00-4:00)
[Screen recording showing advanced technique]

"**Pro move for executives:**

Give ChatGPT examples of YOUR actual writing.

Copy/paste 2-3 of your recent emails (remove confidential stuff) and tell it:

*'This is how I write. Match this style and tone in all future responses.'*

[Shows doing this in real time]

Now it's not just writing like 'a person.'

**It's writing like YOU.**

Your cadence. Your vocabulary. Your vibe.

**This is scary good.**

I did this last week and my assistant asked if I was using AI.

I said yes.

She said she couldn't tell.

**That's the goal.**"

### Homework + Examples (4:00-4:30)
[Quick montage]

"Today's homework:

**Step 1:** Go to ChatGPT settings
**Step 2:** Add custom instructions (use one of mine or write your own)
**Step 3:** Test it with one email

Compare before/after.

**You'll never go back.**

Examples to try:

- 'Write a follow-up email to a prospect who went dark 2 weeks ago'
- 'Draft a message declining a meeting invitation politely'
- 'Write a congratulations note to a team member who closed a big deal'

**Watch how different the tone is.**"
