# Day 1: The 30-Second Email Trick ☕

## Morning Coffee Script (60 seconds max)

### Hook (0-8s)
"Your inbox has 47 unread emails. You need to respond to your board. It's 6 AM.

What if I told you that you're about to do this in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes?"

### The Trick (8-45s)

**Visual: ChatGPT interface, coffee cup in corner**

"Here's the secret formula executives are using:

**Tell ChatGPT THREE things:**
1. **WHO** you are: 'I'm a CEO'
2. **WHAT** you need: 'Write a board update email'
3. **THE VIBE**: 'Professional but optimistic'

[Screen shows typing - fast]
*'I'm a CEO. Write a board update email about our 23% Q4 revenue growth and European expansion. Professional but optimistic. Under 200 words.'*

[ChatGPT types response in 8 seconds]

**Boom.** Your first draft is done.

Edit it in 30 seconds, send it, and you're back to your coffee."

### The Punchline (45-60s)
"That's it. That's the whole trick.

Role. Task. Vibe.

Tomorrow I'll show you how to make it funnier. Or scarier. Or whatever you need.

But for today? Just try it once.

☕ Casper out."
