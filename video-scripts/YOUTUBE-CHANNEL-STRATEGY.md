## For Tomorrow's Golf Meeting

### What To Show Ron:

1. **The full website** - Live, working, payments enabled
2. **Day 1 video** - Actually finished and embedded on site
3. **This document** - The complete YouTube strategy
4. **Revenue projections** - Realistic path to $15K-50K/month

### The Pitch:

*"Ron, I built this entire platform in 6 hours after our call. The website is live. The first video is done. I have a complete 30-day curriculum mapped out.*

*Here's the business model: I make 3 videos per week using Grok AI for basically free. I post them on YouTube. Some people watch for free and I make ad revenue. Others buy the full course for $99. Others click my affiliate links.*

*My cost: $300/month for Grok.*
*Revenue potential: $15K-50K/month within 6 months.*

*I need $5K to run YouTube ads and scale faster. I'll give you 10% equity for that, plus you get lifetime free access and you're in every video testimonial.*

*What do you think?"*
